Ion Auth Database Migration

======================================

Hey everybody,

If you are using the ion auth authentication library and database migrations, 
this is a default migration and insert data that mimic's ion auth's sql file.


INSTALLATION:
- You must have codeigniter-migrations installed (https://github.com/philsturgeon/codeigniter-migrations)
- You must have codeigniter-ion-auth installed (https://github.com/benedmunds/CodeIgniter-Ion-Auth)

Just copy the files from this package to the corresponding folder in your 
application folder.  For example, copy 001_Create_ion_auth.php to 
application/migrations/001_Create_ion_auth.php. 

DOCUMENTATION:
In the migration file you can define the tables for 'groups', 'meta', and 'users' 
to custom table names that you might specify in your ion auth config. This will change all
the instances of the table names correctly.

If you have the variable $use_config set to TRUE, then the migration will pull in the
correct variables from the Ion Auth config file.
-OR-
You could set them manually if you'd like instead of pulling them in from the config file.
Example:
```php
// Tables
private $groups	= 'access';
private $meta = 'profile';
private $users = 'auth';
```

You can also change the join names to correspond with you custom tables:
```php
// Join names
private $groups_join = 'access_id';
private $users_join	= 'auth_id';
```
